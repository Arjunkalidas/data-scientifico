# data-scientifico

This is intended as a journal to update my data science journey

## Introduction

This is a github project to capture the data science journey, machine learning studies, and artificial intelligence.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository is for data science learning, and implementations of various ML algorithms, such as:
- Linear regression
- Clustering
- KMeans Clustering

## Usage

The models are implemented in the standard Jupyter Notebooks. To execute the notebooks, run each cell of the jupyter notebook in the top-down order (You can use `shift + enter` to execute the cells). The datasets are located in the `datasets` folder. The linear regression and clustering uses California Housing dataset, and Iris dataset respectievely.

## Getting involved

You may contribute to this library by adding Jupyter notebooks that teaches a machine learning topic, and contains exercises to practice. You may also choose to improve the existing notebooks. `develop` branch is where you will submit the PR to, which will then be reviewed and merged. Your changes should be submitted via a topic branch for which a meaningful name must be provided and the details of the PR should be included. The changes will be reviewed and merged to `develop` first and then to `master` branch.

## Future roadmap

The short term roadmap includes, but not limited to:
* adding notebooks containing distinct Machine learning topics
* arranging the topics by folders with appropriate documentation
* cleaning up unused or redundant files/folders
* new datasets and analysis for the same
