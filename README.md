This is intended as a journal to update my data science journey

## Description

This repository is for data science learning, and implementations of various ML algorithms, such as:
- Linear regression
- Clustering
- KMeans Clustering

## Usage

The models are implemented in the standard Jupyter Notebooks. To execute the notebooks, run each cell of the jupyter notebook in the top-down order (You can use `shift + enter` to execute the cells). The datasets are located in the `datasets` folder. The linear regression and clustering uses California Housing dataset, and Iris dataset respectievely.
